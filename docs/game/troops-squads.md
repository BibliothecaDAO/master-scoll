### Your Defending Army

Every Realm can only have 1 Defending Army at any one time. You must remember to keep this army fed and well stocked or you may be suffer a raid and loose your relic and resources.

### Attacking Armies

You can create as many attacking armies as you wish, however each battalion counts as 1 population. You use your attacking armies to travel to and raid other Realms.

:::warning

If you run out of food, the vitality of the battalions are affected by 50%, making them easier to be defeated. You must keep your storehouse full of food!
