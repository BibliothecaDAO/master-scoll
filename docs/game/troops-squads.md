### Your Defending Army

Every Realm can only have 1 Defending Army at any one time. You must remember to keep this Army fed and well stocked or you may be suffer a raid and loose your Relic and Resources.

### Attacking Armies

You can create as many Attacking Armies as you wish, however each Battalion counts as 1 Population. You use your attacking Armies to travel to and raid other Realms.

If you run out of food, the vitality of the Battalions are affected by 50%, making them easier to be defeated. You must keep your storehouse full of food!
