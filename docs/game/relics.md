### What are Relics?

Each Realm has a unique relic which it must protect. The people of your Realm worship this relic, and if it is lost, they start to lose hope in your leadership.

### How do you capture a Relic?

You can plunder a relic by raiding another Realm, which youâ€™ll receive along with the resources of a successful raid.

Once you have plundered a relic, it will exist on your attacking Realm until the relic owner successfully raids you back - adding an incentive for retaliation.

Losing your relic affects your happiness rating by -12 points.

It would be wise to build a strong defensive squad to protect your valuable relic.
