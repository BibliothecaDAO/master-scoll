### What are Relics?

Each Realm has a unique Relic which it must protect. The people of your Realm worship this Relic, and if it is lost, they start to lose hope in your leadership.

### How do you capture a Relic?

You can plunder a Relic by Raiding another Realm, which youâ€™ll receive along with the resources of a successful Raid.

Once you have plundered a Relic, it will exist on your attacking Realm until the Relic owner successfully Raids you back - adding an incentive for retaliation.

Losing your Relic affects your happiness rating by -12 points.

It would be wise to build a strong defensive squad to protect your valuable Relic.
