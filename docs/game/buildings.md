# Buildings

---

> With your generated or purchased resources, you can begin to develop and fortify your Realm. Each building will have a positive effect on one statistic but will negatively impact another. It is your job as a ruler to balance this.

---

## Spatial Areas

Buildings take up square space on your Realm so you must choose which ones to build.

You can calculate the spatial area of a Realm by:

> Regions \* Cities + 25 = buildable space

The above formula will give you the Realm’s max buildable squares (which is the constraint) and you can’t build more than this at any given time. If you have built on all available space, you must wait for decay to happen or demolish buildings to create space.

## Building Decay

Buildings in the game decay over time, this means you will have to continuously build your buildings.

Each building decays at a different rate, for example, castles decay slower than a work hut.

## Building Types

### Economic

Work huts are buildings that increase your working population. The greater your population, the greater the output of your resources. A consequence of having a greater population is that you will require more food otherwise your resource generation will be capped at 250 per day - [read more here](./food)

Work huts have a fixed and relative cost based on the resources the Realm has. For example, a Realm with only Wood can build a work hut for 75x Wood, while a Realm with Diamonds, Sapphire and Mithral will need to pay 75 of each.

Once you build work huts they will decay, so it is not a one-time purchase. Work huts decay over 3 days. Once they decay completely, your population will decrease until you rebuild them.

### Military

A Lord must build military buildings to unlock the ability to summon battalions for raiding Realms and defending their raidable vault.

There are four types of military buildings and they unlock different Battalions.

| Building                                                            | Tier 1 Unit                                                            | Tier 2 Unit                                                     |

### Agricultural

**Farms & Fishing Villages**

To keep a positive happiness level, a Realm Lord must ensure that there is enough food for the population at any given time. The higher the population (work huts) and military units on a Realm, the more food required to maintain happiness and therefore increase resource output.

There are two agricultural buildings in the Eternum and they produce two different food:

| Building                                                                 | Food Output | # of harvests |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_farm.png) Farm                       | $WHEAT      | 24 Harvests   |
| ![Buildings](/img/game/buildings/mj_fishing_village.png) Fishing Village | $FISH       | 24 Harvests   |

Each building type allow you 24 harvests. However, you must harvest a maximum of 6 Harvests at anyone time. If you do not harvest, then your farms will decay over time and you will not be as productive as you can be.

:::note
$WHEAT and $FISH can be sold/purchased on the AMM
:::

**Storehouses**

To distribute food to your population and troops, you must convert $FISH/$WHEAT into a storehouse.

Storehouses take up spatial areas on your Realm so you must be strategic about your buildings to ensure you always have enough room to feed your population, and therefore increase your resource output and troop's vitality.

Each 10,000 units of food in a storehouse takes up 2 sqm on your Realm, this means you cannot just hoard food on your Realm otherwise you will not be able to build anything else.
