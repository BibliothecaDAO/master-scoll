## What are Battalions?

Armies are made up of Battalions that you use to raid another Realm and also use to defend your Realm. You build them up individually with resources on each Realm before they can be used.

NOTE: Battalions are not tradable tokens. They only exist on your Realm and you cannot transfer them around. They exist to defend and attack only.

## What are Armies?

Battalions are divided into four categories with stats weighed by the rarity of resource cost. One Army is made of 30 Battalions:

This forms a single army that you can use to raid or you can just use as defense on your Realm. Tier 3 troops offer special bonuses to the whole squad.

If a battalion is slain they are removed from the army and the game.



### The health of an Army
Each Battalion has a different vitality statistic that determines how much health it has. If a Battalion is hurt in battle it does not rejuvenate and heal. Once vitality reaches 0 the Battalion is dead.

If you run out of food, the vitality of the battalions is permanently affected by 50%, making them easier targets. You must keep your storehouse full!
