# Food

## What is Food

Food comes in two forms. $WHEAT and $FISH. You have two options to get food in Eternum. Buy it from the market or grow it.

:::note

If you want to increase your resource production (population) or have a military to attack/defend (Battalions) with a higher vitality, you will need to provide your Realm with food. Food is cheap and every realm can produce (or purchase) it, but you must manage it wisely or suffer the consequences.

## Rivers (Farms) & Harbors (Fishing Villages)

Farms are constrained to the number of rivers you have in your Realm, and fish traps to your harbors. The higher number of farms/fish Traps you have built, the higher yield of wheat/fish youâ€™ll generate.
Each farm/fishing village generates 14,000 $WHEAT/$FISH per day.

## Feeding your population and troops

Once you have harvested or purchased $WHEAT/$FISH, you are able to distribute this food to your population and troops by converting the food into storehouses.

Unlike farms and fish traps, storehouses take up space in your realms spatial area. The more storehouses you build, the more space they take up, but the longer they feed your population and troops. Storehouses deplete at a rate according to how many troops and population you have. The greater the standing army or buildings, the greater the consumption rate.

## Trading excess food on the AMM

Once you harvest either $WHEAT/$FISH from your Farms/Fish Traps, you have the option to trade any excess on the AMM for $LORDS.

In turn, this provides the opportunity for other Lords to purchase them instead of having to build farms/traps and harvesting themselves. A Lord with low rivers/harbors with a penchant for raiding, or simply being time poor can benefit from this, while providing a $LORDS stream to productive farmers.

Wheat and fish will be traded separately, and utility related to net consumptions, will add an interesting economic factor to the game.

## Factors to consider

### Food consumption

Food consumption is calculated by your population. Buildings and battalions count towards your population, the more you have, the faster your food is depleted.

If your Realm runs out of food, you will be permanently capped at 250 resource production and your armies will be at 50% health when they fight, drastically reducing your chances of success.
