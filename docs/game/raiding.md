## Raiding factors to consider

### Cool Down Time

To limit bots, there is a cool down period between raids. After a successful or unsuccessful raid, the defensive Army will have a cool down period before it can be attacked again.

### More Army = More food consumption

Naturally, if you are standing a large squad, your troops need to be fed. You must keep food in your storehouse at all times or else the vitality of your your troops will be capped at 50%.
