# Raiding

---

## Pillage other Realms for resources


Once a Realm has summoned an attacking army (a Realm must have a defending army first), it is able to commence a raid on any Realm belonging to a different Order. If their battalions are victorious, they receive 25% of the defending realm's vault. Realms must defend their vault (with various buildings and armies) if they do not wish to have it pillaged frequently.

## Raiding factors to consider

### Cool Down Time

To limit bots, there is a cool-down period between raids. After a successful or unsuccessful raid, the attacking army must cool down. This cool-down period is at max 10 minutes and can be reduced by building more military buildings.

### More Armies = More food consumption

Naturally, if you are standing a large army, your battalions need to be fed. You must keep food in your storehouse at all times or else the vitality of your battalions will be capped at 50%.

### Combat Simulator

Using this [Combat Simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NZfdXT-fIeoYKhJux-Wa1za0OyVhP2Y2nreEBUODI6o/edit?usp=sharing) (we recommend making and saving a copy for your own use), players can simulate the combat result by inputting the number battalions of the attacking and defending armies. This simulator uses the same logic from the combat contracts in Eternum.
