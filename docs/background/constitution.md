# Constitution

## A preface to the Constitution

Recent events have led us to think deeply about decentralization and how best to set the project up years to come. From the outset of this project we have always strived to be as decentralized as possible, and the project is a example of this. We are governed by a fair release of Realms, and the Core team is shepherding the first versions of the games we are building. 

However, we are building something greater than just a game; we are building an open gaming protocol which anyone can build ontop of. This gaming protocol should not be controlled by any single entity or ‘Team’ it should be built and maintained by *many* entities. The Core team still has a lot of work to do before the protocol is ready, but our long term aspirations is to build *on* the protocol, *not control it*. 

It is the Core teams responsibility to deliver the short term goals, but is the entire DAOs mission to deliver the long term goals.

## What is Bibliotheca DAO?

> “A decentralized game studio, incubator and research lab for on-chain games.”

## Bibliotheca DAO should always

- Stay fully decentralized and not be controlled by any single legal entity
- Fund and nurture projects building in the ecosystem
- Be a place where bleeding edge technology is discussed and built
- Deliver open source, cc0 projects and code
- Be maintainer of Adventurers play to die (P2D) gaming protocol

## Short term mission

- Deliver first production version of Eternum
- Deliver first version of the Adventurers gaming protocol
- V1 tooling to build on-chain games on the Adventures protocol
- Deliver the AMM
- Deliver order book NFT market
- Deliver NFT AMM

## Long term mission
- Incubate on-chain games / media that exist in the universe
- Govern the open gaming protocol
- Self sufficient through protocol fees / LP
- Industry leading research lab incubator for on-chain games
- Build and maintain robust infrastructure to encourage centralized entities to build on the protocol

## The core responsibilities Bibliotheca DAO
- Building, maintaining and balancing the macroeconomic factors of the ecosystem. This includes distribution of Lords and resources and its subcomponents (i.e Realm population and its impact on resource production) and the AMM
- The distillation of Loot items and adventurer creation modules, and the physics layer of equipping items and statistics
- The maintenance of the first game in the ecosystem (Eternum) providing a layer of locational physics and army building
- The item crafting engine
- Player education and marketing
- Maintaining the Adventurers tooling and contracts
- Most importantly - to guide the path towards a thriving decentralized ecosystem building on top of the established Realms/Biblio primitives, ensuring an eternal community - not just eternal code
- Technical advice and development tooling for teams building in the ecosystem (e.g token sink design and on-chain game loops), and the decision making process behind shared incentives and grants
